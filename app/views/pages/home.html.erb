<h1>Welcome to Team Assassins</h1>
<div class="description container">
    <p>
    Hi! This website is for people to help administrate a game of Assassins.
    It will handle doing things like assigning targets, sending notifications 
    to players of their targets, and handling the scorekeeping. 
    </p>

    <p>
    If you are the admin for a game, enter your key to access your game. If you
    are just visiting, feel free to view current games.
    </p>

    <p>
    Although intended for team games, you can also play free-for-all games by 
    making just one team and then click on "Assign targets (free-for-all)".
    </p>

    <p>
    Have fun!
    </p>
